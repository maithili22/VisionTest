## Project Overview

Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring that all functionalities work as expected before a product is released. This tool simplifies the process of creating test cases by analyzing UI screenshots and generating comprehensive, step-by-step testing instructions. It is designed to save time for developers and testers, providing clear, actionable test cases to ensure the quality and reliability of digital products.

## Features

- **Multi-image Upload:** Upload multiple screenshots of the UI you want to test.
- **Optional Context:** Provide additional context to generate more accurate test cases.
- **Automated Test Case Generation:** Generates detailed test cases including descriptions, pre-conditions, testing steps, and expected results.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface powered by Streamlit for ease of use.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-end:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Back-end:** [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for LLM integration
- **Multimodal LLM:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash via Google Generative AI API

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google Cloud API Key

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maithili22/VisionTest.git

```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Up Google API Key

Add your Google API key to the environment variables:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-google-api-key'
```

## Usage

### Running the App

To start the Streamlit app, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Using the Tool

1. **Upload Screenshots:** Drag and drop your UI screenshots into the upload section.
2. **Add Context (Optional):** Enter any additional context that might help in generating more precise test cases.
3. **Generate Test Cases:** Click on the 'Describe Testing Instructions' button. The tool will analyze the screenshots and generate detailed test cases.
4. **Review Results:** Review the generated test cases, which will include:
   - Description of the test case.
   - Pre-conditions for testing.
   - Step-by-step testing instructions.
   - Expected results.

## How It Works

1. **Image Processing:** The uploaded UI screenshots are processed by a multimodal LLM, which analyzes the visual elements and layout.
2. **Test Case Generation:** The LLM generates test cases based on the visual analysis and any provided context, using a predefined prompt structure.
3. **Output:** The tool produces a list of test cases, each clearly detailing the steps to test the UI features, ensuring thorough and comprehensive testing.

## Example Test Cases

Here are some examples of the types of test cases generated by the tool:

### Test Case 1: Login Form Validation
- **Description:** Test the validation of the login form fields.
- **Pre-conditions:** The login page is open.
- **Testing Steps:**
  1. Leave the username field empty.
  2. Enter an invalid email format in the email field.
  3. Enter a short password.
  4. Click the login button.
- **Expected Result:** Error messages should appear for each invalid field.

### Test Case 2: Navigation Menu Functionality
- **Description:** Test the functionality of the navigation menu items.
- **Pre-conditions:** The user is logged in and on the dashboard.
- **Testing Steps:**
  1. Click each menu item.
  2. Verify that the correct page loads for each item.
  3. Check that the active menu item is highlighted.
- **Expected Result:** Each menu item should lead to the correct page, and the active item should be visually distinct.
